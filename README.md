# barcodeScript
I made this script using pillow 9.5.0 and python to make simple barcodes for passwords and repetitious task. 

on linux: 

*open folder in terminal

type:
pip install pillow==9.5.0 
  hit enter

To run: 
  go to working directory aka the script's location and in terminal type "python3 BarcodePass.py"
  your folder should have the barcode .png inside of it.

Enjoy!!!!!
